# Codenames
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game)

Entire project lives inside `/project`. All other files are auto-generated using:
```
python3 project/freeze.py
```

This allows the game to run statically from github-pages. Make sure you run this command before pushing whenever you add changes.
